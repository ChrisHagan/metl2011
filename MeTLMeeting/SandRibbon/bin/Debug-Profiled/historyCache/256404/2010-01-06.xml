 - The significant metric to MeTL is how many messages are passed per second.
    For instance, if a single teacher writes publicly while 200 students watch,
    that is 200 messages.  If each of those students then writes a private note, 
    that is another 200 messages.   Private content is much less costly than

 - It depends how much data they are storing.  Investigations continue.

How many existing users can be simultaneously logged in?
 - The significant metric to MeTL is how many messages are passed per second.
    For instance, if a single teacher writes publicly while 200 students watch,
    that is 200 messages.  If each of those students then writes a private note, 
    that is another 200 messages.   Private content is much less costly than 
    public content because it is much more tightly broadcast.
    
    The average pen stroke is about 4.5 Kb, and our MeTL servers can pass about
    7500 of them each second.  Thus 85 people can write simultaneously, drawing
    a stroke every second.  It is important to note that this is not the same profile
