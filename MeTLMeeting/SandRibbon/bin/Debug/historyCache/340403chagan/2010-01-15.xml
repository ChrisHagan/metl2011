and low fidelity.

It lets you be human and build content
live, letting your students in our your thought
processes instead of just the results.

It combines the collaboration and inclusiveness
of the web with professional quality authoring
tools, streamlined for intuitive live presentation.

Conversations in MeTL never end.

From the source presentation the teacher built
for last year&apos;s class to the hasty revision at the end
of next year, all the content in MeTL is simultaneous
and available.

Every side note and appendix is there to review,
and you can answer the questions everyone keeps
asking right next to the puzzling point from last week&apos;s
lecture.</text><tag>{&quot;author&quot;:&quot;chagan&quot;,&quot;privacy&quot;:&quot;public&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;chagan:15/01/2010 10:37:14 AM&quot;}</tag><style>Normal</style><family>Arial</family><weight>Normal</weight><size>20</size><decoration>None</decoration><author>chagan</author><identity>chagan:15/01/2010 10:37:14 AM</identity><target>presentationSpace</target><privacy>private</privacy><slide>340403</slide><color>#FF000000</color></textbox></message>
