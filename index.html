<p>This is a teaching and learning developed at Monash University and opened under the Apache license in 2015.</p>

<p>It enables hundreds of students to participate in a shared electronic context.  Content can be visually shared across whiteboard spaces, which are backed by arbitrary images or Powerpoint presentations.  Participants can publish and respond to quizzes, submit screenshots of their private work to the teacher, retrieve submissions and work in any medium.</p>

<p>MeTL exposes native clients, web clients and embeddable live images for use in Content Management or Learning Management systems.  If you can add an iframe tag to your Moodle block, you can use MeTL.</p>

<p>Conversations in MeTL are persistent.  They go from pre-class to large scale teaching events and become useful study resources afterwards.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>MeTL was authored by Chris Hagan (<a href="https://github.com/ChrisHagan" class="user-mention">@ChrisHagan</a>) and David Hagan.  During the journey dozens of teachers, programmers, testers and researchers were involved in the effort.</p>
