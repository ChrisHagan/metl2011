This section will walk you through the exercise of obtaining the Windows MeTL client.

This set of instructions is for Windows only.  Other operating systems are able to interact with the MeTL system through web interfaces, which will be covered in a different section.

It will take you through the basics of starting a conversation, enabling your students to find it and reviewing the activities within it when you're done.

No actual students are required for this exercise, we'll provide some.  We're sorry that they're a bit resistant to education, it was an off day when we programmed them.

Click here to [download the MeTL client](http://metl.adm.monash.edu/MeTLTeacher/MeTL%20Teacher.application).  You'll need this to write some content.

Run the MeTL client, and select the "MeTL Demo Server" from the server list.  The others are closed to you right now.

Choose a username for this session.  It's not time to worry about proving who you are, this is just a walkthrough.  We'll be destroying the content you've put in here at some point in the next 24 hours.

[Click here]() to initiate a new conversation from the browser.

Now select this conversation from the search results to join in.  In this scenario, you're a student because you didn't create the conversation (it was created for you and the teacher was called Mr. Roboto).

Try writing something.  You can type, publish images, answer polls and publish your own.

Try selecting your content.  You can hide it from the rest of the class or show it to them.  On the right, you'll see a list of slides in this conversation.

[Click here]() to ask Mr. Roboto to publish some new slides.  He can do this without missing a beat in MeTL.

[Click here]() to ask some more bots to join in.  Don't be alarmed, they're harmless.

You'll notice that Mr. Roboto's screen only shows people's public work, and that it does so in real time.  Some teachers use this to put a screen behind them which doesn't show their private content.

When you've finished teasing the robots, [click here]() to analyze the conversation you've just had.
