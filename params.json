{"name":"Metl2011","tagline":"C# WPF MeTL client","body":"### Welcome to MeTL.\r\nThis is a teaching and learning developed at Monash University and opened under the Apache license in 2015.\r\n\r\nIt enables hundreds of students to participate in a shared electronic context.  Content can be visually shared across whiteboard spaces, which are backed by arbitrary images or Powerpoint presentations.  Participants can publish and respond to quizzes, submit screenshots of their private work to the teacher, retrieve submissions and work in any medium.\r\n\r\nMeTL exposes native clients, web clients and embeddable live images for use in Content Management or Learning Management systems.  If you can add an iframe tag to your Moodle block, you can use MeTL.\r\n\r\nConversations in MeTL are persistent.  They go from pre-class to large scale teaching events and become useful study resources afterwards.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMeTL was authored by Chris Hagan (@ChrisHagan) and David Hagan.  During the journey dozens of teachers, programmers, testers and researchers were involved in the effort.\r\n\r\nProfessor Gordon Sanson was the director and designer of MeTL, and continues to be a primary advocate for it, now at Saint Leo University, Florida.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
